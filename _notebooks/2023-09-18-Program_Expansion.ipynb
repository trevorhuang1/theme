    "    The third issue took by far the longest to resolve, mainly because I overthought it and was looking in the wrong places.

Looking back, I realize now this is likely because of the code that was converting the tif file to a jpg, whereas this command may have already saved the image as a jpg file. But, I quickly realized that the original output.tif file had a perfectly cropped image, and I didn't need to do any more work to get that image to masked.tif, and simply replaced the masked.tif references in the rest of the program with output.tif and commented out the code cropping the image file to exact boundaries."
