    "I came into this class with little to no coding experience. At first, it felt like I was trapped in a maze with no idea of how to get out. However as the weeks rolled by, I started to navigate through this maze with the aid of my teachers, classmates, and friends and my knowledge slowly started to grow. Over the past almost 12 weeks, I've found myself starting to get over the learning curve and make my way though this maze. Now that I'm approaching the end, I know that there will be more challenges in the next trimester of this class, but I am ready to tackle them as a stronger, more resilient person than I was this summer. This experience has been super rewarding for me and I can only thank the people who have supported me throughout this journey. I feel nothing but anticipation and excitement for the next trimester of this class, and I hope that I can finish this year as a fully fledged coder ready to take on CSA."
