## Week 0 Summary:
I set up the website and began to alter it. Throughout the setup process, I encountered issues with WSL, as I was stuck as "root". This was solved by uninstalling then reinstalling WSL. I also ran into an error: "Wsl/Service/CreateInstance/MountVhd/ERROR_FILE_NOT_FOUND". However, with the help of ChatGPT, "wsl --unregister Ubuntu" and "wsl --install -d Ubuntu" solved the issue. The rest of my time was spent practicing committing and pushing to github as well as adding my freeform photo to my home page.
