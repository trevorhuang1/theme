description: An old shopping list program that I revised
type: hacks
courses: { compsci: {week: 3} }
---

/*
  Whenever we go shopping, we have a list of stuff we want to buy.
  Create a program in which a user can store their name, the list of
  stuff they want, the day they plan to go shopping,their 
  phone number and a password. 

  Features:
  Pt 1:
  The program will ask if the user has created an account before.
  If so, it will ask for the name and then the password. Do not
  worry about whether or not they inputted something wrong.
  If not, ask them to create an account by asking for phone number,
  name and password

  Pt2:
  The program will ask what the user wants to buy. The user will type in a command if they are done, and the program will ask what day they plan to shop in. Then it will go back to login. Otherwise, it will add the item to the list and ask again.  

  Pt3:
  Keep on running the program until the user wants to leave the program
  You must include these cases:
  User switches accounts
  if the account exists: 
    User wants to add more stuff to the list
    User wants to change their email and phone number

// var list = {item: "apple"};
// fruit = list["item"] //or list.item;

<script>
// Initialize an empty shopping list array
let shoppingList = [];

// Function to add items to the shopping list
function addToShoppingList(item) {
    shoppingList.push(item);
    console.log(`${item} has been added to the shopping list.`);
}

// Main program loop
while (true) {
    // Prompt the user for input
    let userInput = prompt("Enter an item to add to the shopping list (or type 'quit' to exit):");

    // Check if the user wants to quit
    if (userInput.toLowerCase() === 'quit') {
        break;
    }

    // Add the item to the shopping list
    addToShoppingList(userInput);
}

// Print the final shopping list
console.log("\nHere is your final shopping list:");
shoppingList.forEach(item => {
    console.log(item);
});
