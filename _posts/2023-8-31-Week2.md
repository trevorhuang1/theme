## Week 2 Summary:
This is when I started major progress on the snake game, calculator, and the quiz. I mainly focused on the snake game and my partner Kyle did a lot of work on the quiz. A really irritating issue was that whenever I started the snake game, the screen would move up and down when I used the arrow keys. I fixed the problem with a couple lines of code I found online. Additionally, I changed the colors of the snake game to make it look better. I didn't know how to get the calculator working until a friend helped link the style.css file to the calculator.md file. Kyle and I decided to make our quiz on guessing movie titles based on a combination of emojis.
