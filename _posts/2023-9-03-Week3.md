### Plans for Week 3:
1. Follow along in class and clone the student repository again.
2. Get the snake game working and fix the colors
3. Learn basic python and get used to working with jupyter notebooks
4. Create a calculator that works
5. Make some other mini-projects
6. Make the website look more attractive

## Week 3 Summary:
It was a productive week where Kyle and I got a lot done. For whatever reason, my calculator just would not work and I think it has to do with my theme. However, we were able to make a tic tac toe mini game as well as a math quiz. I worked on the snake game and a really annoying glitch was that the screen would move when I pressed the arrow keys, but I was able to find a fix online.
